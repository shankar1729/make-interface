# Make lattice-matched interfaces of complex crystals

Create stoichiometric surfaces of crystals and interfaces between two crystals based on supercell size and lattice match constraints.
This package uses ASE to read/write crystal structures and evaluate energies to optimize cuts and stackings in building interfaces.
Consequently, any structure formats and interatomic potentials supoprted by ASE can be used with this package.
See `examples/` for detailed usage examples.
